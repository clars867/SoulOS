    "## Higgs Boson Conceptual Representation\n",
    "A Higgs boson is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field around its nonzero vacuum value. In the Standard Model, you start from the Higgs field $\\Phi (an \\mathrm{SU}(2)_L$ complex doublet) and its Lagrangian density.\n",

    "That $-\\mu^2$ term is often called tachyonic [tachyonic: having a negative mass-squared term that signals an instability of the symmetric point, not faster-than-light motion].\n",
