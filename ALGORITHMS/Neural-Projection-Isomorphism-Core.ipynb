    "**Translational Kinetic Energy ($\\text{KE}$ or $K$)** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $m$ is the **mass** of the object (in kilograms, kg).\n",
    "* $v$ is the **velocity** (speed) of the object (in meters per second, m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "This kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion, and it is typically measured in **Joules (J)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and fundamental equation for **average velocity ($\\bar{v}$) ** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{\\Delta d}{\\Delta t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\bar{v}$ is the **average velocity** (a vector quantity, including both speed and direction).\n",
    "* $\\Delta d$ (or $\\Delta x$) is the **displacement** (the change in position, also a vector quantity).\n",
    "* $\\Delta t$ is the **time interval** over which the displacement occurred.\n",

    "Since velocity is a **vector** quantity, you must always specify the **direction** of motion (e.g., $10\\text{ m/s}$ north, or $-5\\text{ m/s}$ in the x-direction).\n",

    "\n",
    "If an object is moving with a constant acceleration ($\\text{a}$), you can find its **final velocity ($\\text{v}$)** using this kinematic equation:\n",

    "## Notes 2 (Projector Physics)\n",
    "The physics of projectors is based on the principles of geometric optics and involves mathematical formulas to determine image size, distance, and focus. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thin Lens Equation \n",
    "The primary mathematical model used to describe how a projector lens forms an image is the thin lens equation. This equation relates the focal length of the lens to the distances of the image and the object (the internal display chip). \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{d_{o}}+\\frac{1}{d_{i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "* $f$ is the focal length of the lens (a property of the lens itself). For the converging lenses used in projectors, the focal length is a positive value.\n",
    "* $d_{o}$ is the object distance, the distance from the center of the lens to the image source (e.g., the DLP chip or LCD panel).* $d_{i}$ is the image distance, the distance from the center of the lens to the screen or projection surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnification and Image Size \n",
    "The equation for magnification $(M)$ determines how much larger the projected image is compared to the internal display chip. Magnification is a ratio of heights or distances. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "M=\\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}}=-\\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "* $h_{i}$ is the height of the projected image.\n",
    "* $h_{o}$ is the height of the original image source (the display chip).\n",
    "* $d_{i}$ is the image distance.\n",
    "* $d_{o}$ is the object distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The negative sign in the formula for lenses indicates that the image produced is a real, inverted image. Projectors compensate for this inversion internally so the final image appears upright to the viewer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Throw Ratio \n",
    "A practical application of the mathematics of projection is the throw ratio. This is a specific geometric relationship (similar triangles) that helps installers determine where to place a projector for a desired screen size. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Throw\\ Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Throw\\ Distance\\ (D)}}{\\text{Image\\ Width\\ (W)}}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "For example, a throw ratio of 2:1 means that for every 2 feet of distance from the screen, the image will be 1 foot wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Image Processing \n",
    "Beyond optics, the digital processing involves complex mathematical algorithms: Linear algebra is used to scale, rotate, and transform the pixel matrices (the image data) for various adjustments like keystone correction, which uses trigonometric calculations to make a trapezoidal image look rectangular when the projector is tilted. Calculus models light intensity to ensure even illumination and brightness across the entire screen."
