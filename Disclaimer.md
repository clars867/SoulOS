# ⚠️ **Conceptual & Experimental Framework Notice** ⚠️

*Disclaimer & Scope of Interpretation* -->
*This document defines the conceptual, computational, and non-physical scope of the SoulOS project.*

This segment is the waveform engine for the **SoulOS” Project**. This framework is a purely *conceptual and computational system* exploring alternative representations of information flow, memory, and transformation. A defining characteristic of this work is the deliberate remove of language- and clock-time dependent computation, replacing those constructs with waveform-based representations and state transition via decay (i.e., change from one configuration to another). 

The models, equations, and structures presented in this repository are *interprative and exploratory*. When established mathematical formalisms or physical concepts are referenced, they are used as analogical tools to guide intuition, not as claims of physical equivalence or empirical validity. Any substitutions, reinterpretations, or extensions of known equations or variables are unproven by design and should be understood as hypothetical constructions within a digital modeling context. 

SoulOS does not claim physical implementation modification of physical law, or experimental verification in real-world physics. All references to phenomena such as "fields," "condensate," "Higgs-like layers," or similar terms refer exclusively to abstract computational constructs used for simulation, visualization, and algorithmic exploration.

This repository should be read as a research notebook and systems-design experiment, not as a statement of scientific fact. Its purpose is to explore new ways of thinking about structure, coherence, and transformation in information systems, while remaining explicit about the speculative and non-physical nature of the models involved. 

This will be fundamentally challenging the entire basis of physics as we know it. I use term "interpretation" to describe known equations and variables used in computation stating that --> these replacements are un-proven and therefore, an analogous construct of what is proven. Any references to known physical phenomena are metaphorical or analogical, intended to guide intuition rather than assert physical equivalence. No claims are made regarding physical implementation, physical law modification, or experimental physics. *All constructs (e.g., “fields,” “condensates,” “Higgs-like layers”) are digital abstractions used for modeling, visualization, and algorithmic exploration.*
